Very basic codes to start git

cd	-change directory
cd /X	-change the drive X-drive letter
/	-specific directry
~	-home directory
	 use cd to change / to ~
ls	-list contents
cd xxx	-enter directory xxx

clone

first	-configure your git account for our github repository
	code - git config --global user.name "Git_Username"
	     - git config --global user.email ****your_email_address
Now
-you need the link of your repository from your git account
-copy the link from there
-git clone *****paste the link you copied*****

Now, you can use your repository locally.


-What you can do now is create new file in your working directory for your git
 and save your work.

For example:
	-create a filename.txt file and save as usual file
	
	-go to git bash and type
		git add filename.txt
	
	-make a comment for your file
		git commit -m "first commit" text.txt

	-finally, push your file to your repository
		git push -u origin master

	-to check if any changes is done to your file
		git status

DONE !!
